Make the following changes to the program:
(i) Change the program to display an extra line of output when the user wins, showing the number of guesses taken.When the program is run the output may now look as follows:
Welcome to the guessing game!
    
(ii) The program does not display a message unless the user guesses the secret number.
Change the program so that it displays one of the following messages as a hint to the user:
‘Sorry! Your guess was too low’ or ‘Sorry! Your guess was too high’
When the program is run the output may now look as follows:

(iii) Currently the program has no way of ending unless the user guesses the secret
number.
Change the program so that it does not allow the user more than three guesses. This is
the value currently being passed into the function.
Hint: You will need to change the loop so that it continues as long as the user’s guess
is not equal to the secret number and the number of guesses is less than
max_guesses_allowed.

(iv)Currently the number of guesses that the user is allowed is hard coded to three.
Modify the program so that the user is presented with the prompt:
Enter the maximum number of guesses allowed.
Store the value entered as an integer and pass this value into the function
guess_game.
When the program is run the output may now look as follows:

v)Currently the secret number is always between 1 and 5 inclusive.
Modify the program so that it prompts the user to enter a difficulty level – ‘E’ for easy
and ‘H’ for hard. If the user chooses ‘H’ the secret number should be between 1 and
100 inclusive. A value of anything other than ‘H’ can be interpreted as easy.
When the program is run the output may now look as follows:

(vi) Modify the code so that if the user guesses a number that was already guessed the following message is displayed: ‘You already guessed this number.’
When the program is run the output may now look as follows:
