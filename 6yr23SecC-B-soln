(i) Currently the first line that is printed by the program is “Multiplication program”.
Change the program so that the first line printed is “Times Table program”.
When the program is run the output may now look as follows:

(ii) Update the program so that a row of asterisks appears above and below the line which
outputs “Times Table program”.
When the program is run the output may now look as follows:

(iii) Amend the program to ask for and accept the user's choice of number to be used as
the multiplier. Store the entered number in the variable called number.
When the program is run and the user enters 8 as the number, the output may now
look as follows:

(iv) Currently the user can enter a negative number. Negative numbers should not be
allowed in this program. Amend the program so that the times table is not printed out
and an appropriate error message is displayed if the user enters a negative number.
When the program is run and the user enters -2 as the number, the output may now
look as follows:

(v) Times tables normally shows the result of multiplying a specific number by zero to
twelve inclusive. Amend the program so it displays the results of multiplying the
entered number by zero to twelve inclusive.
When the program is run and the user enters the number 8, the output may now look
as follows:
